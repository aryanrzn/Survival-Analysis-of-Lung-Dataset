# Survival-Analysis-of-Lung-Dataset

Lung cancer has always been one of the most serious cancers in the world, especially in the advanced stages, where survival rates and treatment outcomes are of great concern [1]. Despite recent advances in the detection, pathologic diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, many patients still develop advanced stages that are incurable and progressively fatal.[2]
Survival analysis methods provide a powerful tool when conducting an analysis of survival time in patients with advanced lung cancer. The method of survival analysis can help us to understand the temporal pattern of disease progression and the factors that may have an impact on the survival time of the patient. Such methods are particularly useful for dealing with events that may not have occurred by the end of the study, a common problem in clinical trials and medical research.

”Right Censor” data are characterized by the fact that the survival time of certain individuals is unknown at the end of the study. This type of data requires the use of special statistical techniques, such as Kaplan-Meier estimators or Cox proportional risk models, to deal with this type of censoring. These methods can provide reasonable estimates of the distribution of survival times as well as interpretability of associated factors.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the key variables that influence the distribution of survival time in patients with advanced lung cancer. In particular, we hoped to answer the following core research question:

- • What factors may significantly influence the distribution of survival time?
- • What is the distribution of survival time (T)?
- • For important parameters, How to find point estimates and interval estimates.

The following report will be structured as follows. In section 2, we will briefly describe the lung data set. In section 3, we will describe the main methods that appear in this article. In section 4 to section 6 we will present the main results of the research. Finally, in sections 7 and 8, we will describe the conclusion and discussion.
